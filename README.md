# cemtool: The interactive cost-effectiveness model tool to build a simple Markov model in R

There are multiple software systems that are able to build Markov models for cost-effectiveness analyses like TreeAge, Excel or R. Although there are numerous advantages to use R over the others, the biggest downside is the steep learning curve from R. The cemtool package aims to close this gap by introducing a step-by-step guidance to build default Markov models. cemtool guides the user though the steps of building a Markov model and will present the final result using graphs and tables. The only prerequisite is that the user knows the structure of the model and the transition probabilities, no calculations or code is required.
