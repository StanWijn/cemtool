Version: 0.4
Author: S.R.W. Wijn
Maintainer: S.R.W. Wijn <stan.wijn@radboudumc.nl>
Description: Markov models are increasingly used to determine the cost-effectiveness of medical innovations. However, medical researchers still use closed source software to build such models. The ceom-package was build to guide researchers to build their own Markov model in R.The current version supports Markov models that consist of 3 to 6 health-states.
