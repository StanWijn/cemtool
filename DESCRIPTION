Title: Step by step guide to build a Markov model
Version: 0.2
Author: S.R.W. Wijn
Maintainer: S.R.W. Wijn <stan.wijn@radboudumc.nl>
Description: Markov models are increasingly used to determine the cost-effectiveness of medical innovations. However, medical researchers still use closed source software to build such models. The ceom-package was build to guide researchers to build their own Markov model in R.The current version supports Markov models that consist of 3 to 6 health-states. More options will be added in the future.  Do you want to join development? Let us know by contacting the package author.
